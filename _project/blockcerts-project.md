[Learning Machine](https://www.learningmachine.com/) incubated [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org) with MIT Media Lab in 2016 as an open source, open standard for creating, issuing, and verifying digital records. I was principal architect and developer for this work.

The [Blockcerts Roadmap (draft)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/blockcerts_roadmap.md) describes our current focus, including adoption of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials alignment. Our paper [Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.pdf) describes Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials alignment in depth.
